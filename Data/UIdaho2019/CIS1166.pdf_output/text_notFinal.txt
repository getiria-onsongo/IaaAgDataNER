CHARLES 
Two-Row Winter Malt Barley
by Juliet M. Windes and Don Obert 
Until now, all winter barley varieties have been
feed types. Growers have been seeking a winter
malt barley, because the yield potential for win-
ter barley significantly exceeds that of spring
barley and may require less irrigation over the
length of the growing season. In years where
winterkill wasn’t an issue, winter barley yields
averaged over 25 bu/A more than spring barley
(1997-2007) in extension variety trials in south-
ern and southeastern Idaho. 
In 2005, “Charles” winter malt barley was
released by the USDA-ARS, Aberdeen, ID, and
the University of Idaho Agricultural Experiment
Station (AES). This is the first winter malt type
barley accepted by the American Malting Barley
Association (AMBA) as having adequate malt
quality and brewing characteristics. The poten-
tial for increased yields in a winter malt barley
variety should lead to increased profitability
over spring malt types.
History
Charles (Reg. no. CV-321, PI 637845), a two-row
winter malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), was
named in honor of the late Dr. Charles F.
“Chuck” Murphy, former USDA-ARS National
Program Leader for Small Grains. Dr. Murphy
was instrumental in the success of the oat and
barley breeding program at Aberdeen for many
years.  
Charles was tested as experimental line
94Ab1274 and is a selection from the cross
“Bearpaw”/81Ab1702. (Bearpaw is a two-row
barley from Montana State University with
excellent malt quality, and 81Ab1702 is a winter
barley with good malt characteristics.) Pedigree
selection was followed for maturity, height, lodg-
ing resistance, resistance to shattering, and
favorable head type in the F2 through F4 gener-
ations grown under irrigated conditions at
Aberdeen, ID. 
Charles was selected as an F5 head row, des-
ignated no. 1274, in 1994 for a favorable head
type and resistance to lodging and shattering. It
was evaluated in replicated yield trials from
1998 to 2004 at Aberdeen, ID, and was tested in
2001 and 2003 in the Western Winter Regional
Barley Trials and University of Idaho Extension
trials. It was entered into AMBA pilot scale qual-
ity evaluation trials in 2000 and 2002, and
received favorable ratings each year. Following
the favorable rating in 2002, it was recom-
mended for advancement to plant-scale malting
and brewing evaluation. Charles received a
favorable malting rating for the first two years of
plant-scale evaluation, and brewing tests are
underway. It is being grown on over 11,000 acres
to further assess its malting and brewing poten-
tial, and was added to the 2009 list of AMBA
accepted malt varieties.

Description
Charles has rough awns with a moderately lax
spike. The kernel has a wrinkled hull with
prominent veins, and a white aleurone.
Charles heads 10 days earlier than “Sunstar
Pride” feed barley (Sunderman Breeding) and 1
day later than “Eight-Twelve” feed barley
(Wesenberg et al., 1992) . When grown under
irrigated and dryland conditions, Charles is
equal in height to Eight-Twelve. 
In three years of irrigated extension trials
from 2005 to 2007 (table 1), Charles lodged
slightly more than Eight-Twelve (16% versus
11%, respectively), and less than Kamiak (20%).
Charles has shown excellent yield potential
compared with “88Ab536-B” (Wesenberg et al.,
1998), the only current winter barley with suit-
able malting quality characteristics adapted to
the intermountain west area. 88Ab536-B is a
six-row winter line released as germplasm.

Adaptation and performance 
Charles was tested over seven location-years in
1998, and from 2000 to 2004. It averaged 161
bu/A compared with 173 bu/A for the feed bar-
ley Eight-Twelve and 147 bu/A for 88Ab536-B.
Eight-Twelve has consistently performed well in
Idaho and is a long-term check cultivar in
USDA-ARS trials. Charles was tested in the
Western Winter Regional Barley trials over five
location-years from 2001 to 2002, where it
yielded 129 bu/A compared with 164 bu/A for
Eight-Twelve. In University of Idaho Extension
trials across seventeen location-years from 2001
to 2007, Charles yielded 137 bu/A and had 50.7
lb/bu test weight, compared with 144 bu/A and
49.7 lbs/bu test weight for Eight-Twelve. 
In Idaho, Charles is expected to be best
adapted to the irrigated areas of the southern
Snake River plain. It has good to excellent win-
ter survival at Aberdeen in the absence of snow
mold (caused by Microdochium nivale (ces. Ex
Berl. & Vogl.) Samuels & Hallet), but stands may
be severely reduced in open, cold winters.
Survival is significantly reduced by snow mold
when extended snow cover occurs. Although
there has been no incidence of barley stripe rust
(causal agent Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp.
hordei Ericks. & Henn.) on Charles, the occur-
rence of this disease is so infrequent that it has
not been present at any winter barley testing
locations. The only incidence of barley stripe rust
has been at spring barley locations. Therefore,
based on pedigree information only, we would
not presume Charles to have resistance to stripe
rust.
Malt quality characteristics
Kernel plumpness was determined from samples
collected over 17 irrigated and rain-fed environ-
ments. Kernels retained on a sieve with 0.24 by
1.9 cm slotted openings were considered plump
(American Society of Brewing Chemists, 1992).
Charles had 93% plump kernels compared with
88% for Eight-Twelve. Across nine irrigated envi-
ronments, Charles averaged 97% plump kernels,
compared with 87% for 88Ab536-B. 
Malting quality was assessed in laboratory
tests at the USDA-ARS Cereal Crop Research Unit
in Madison, WI, and in pilot scale tests by
AMBA. In USDA-ARS trials from 1998 to 2001,
and in 2003, Charles was evaluated with
88Ab536-B in six tests. Compared with
88Ab536-B, Charles had greater malt extract
(81.3 vs.78.9%), higher α-amylase activity (69.8
vs. 52.3 20°C dextrinizing units, lower β-glucan
concentration (149 vs. 261 mg g–1), higher wort
protein (5.23 vs. 4.81%), and a higher ratio of
soluble/total protein (45.4 vs. 40.1%). Charles
and 88Ab536-B each met acceptable industry
standards for grain protein (12.0 vs. 12.4%) and
wort color (1.9 vs. 2.1). Charles is inferior to
88Ab536-B for diastatic power (114 vs. 141
°ASBC).
Charles was also evaluated in winter-spring
drill strips with the spring two-row malt stan-
dard Harrington (Harvey and Rossnagel, 1984)
in six tests from 1999 to 2001 and 2003. Charles
had higher levels of malt extract (80.9 vs.
79.4%), α-amylase activity (71.0 vs. 58.9 20°C
dextrinizing units), and diastatic power (114 vs.
103 °ASBC), than Harrington. Charles had more
favorable values of β-glucan concentration (177
vs. 400 mg g–1) and grain protein (12.2 vs.
13.0%) compared with Harrington. 
Charles and Harrington both met industry
standards for wort color (1.9 vs. 1.6), wort pro-
tein (5.14 vs. 4.94%), and the ratio of solu-
ble/total protein (43.7 vs. 40.3%). In pilot scale
testing by AMBA in 2000 and 2002, Charles was
superior to 88Ab536-B for malt extract (81.3 vs.
80.2%), α-amylase activity (72.8 vs. 66.0 208C
DU), and percentage of plump kernels (94 vs.
76%). Charles and 88Ab536-B both met malt
industry standards for wort color (1.8 vs. 2.1),
wort protein (5.42 vs. 5.53%), diastatic power
(141 vs. 174 °ASBC), and the ratio of solu-
ble/total protein (44.0 vs. 45.6%). However, in
the AMBA testing, β-glucan levels for both
Charles and 88Ab536-B were unfavorable, with
values of 292 and 179 mg g–1, respectively.
