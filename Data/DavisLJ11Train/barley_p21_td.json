It was evaluated as Entry 691 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from\n1984-1985 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 24:1210 (1984)\n\nHEAVYWEIGHT\nHeavyweight is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Greenway Seeds, Idaho. Its experimental\ndesignation was PB 29. It is medium maturing and has mid-tall plant height and good straw strength. It was evaluated as\nEntry 693 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1984-1985 for spring planting in the intermountain region of\nnorthern California.\n\nHECTOR\nHector is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Agriculture Canada at Lethbridge, Alberta, in 1973. It was\nselected from the cross Betzes/Palliser. It is medium maturing and has mid-tall plant height and poor straw strength.\nHector has a rough awn, yellow aleurone, and a horseshoe depression tending to crease. It has a mid-sized to small\nkernel and the rachilla is mid-to-long with long hairs. It has been recommended as a dryland feed barley. It was\nevaluated as Entry 629 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-1984 for spring planting in the\nintermountain region of northern California.\n\nHOCKETT\nHockett is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was developed by the Montana AES and released in 2008. It was\nderived from the cross ND7293/Bearpaw. It is adapted for dryland production, and when compared to Harrington,\nHockett has a higher yield and better malt quality under dryland conditions. It averages 37 inches in plant height and has\npoor straw strength (susceptible to lodging). It is susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1197 in the UC\nRegional Cereal Testing program in 2006 and 2011 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern\nCalifornia.\n\nHORSFORD\nHorsford is a six-rowed spring hooded forage barley. It includes a number of similar barleys of separate origins, the first\nof these produced in Vermont in 1879. It was selected from a cross of Nepal with one of the common six-rowed bearded\nbarleys of the Eastern states. It is the first known hybrid barley produced in the United States. It was grown extensively\nin Washington at the turn of the century (1900\u2019s). It is medium-late maturing, tall and susceptible to lodging. The basal\nrachis internode is straight or sometimes curved. The rachis is tough with short-haired edges. The spike is lax, short to\nmid-long, parallel, slightly waxy, erect to inclined. The lemma is hooded and hoods are elevated without an appendage\non the middle lobe or with a very short one. The glume awn is equal in length to the glume and is rough. Glumes are\none-half to two-thirds the length of the lemma and are covered with short hairs. The rachilla is short haired. Kernels are\nblue, mid-long to long, and hulls are slightly wrinkled to wrinkled. Horsford is best adapted to dryland and irrigated\nareas in the Pacific Northwest and northern Great Plains. It was evaluated as Entry 1224 in the UC Regional Cereal\nTesting program in 2007 as a forage barley for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n\nIDAGOLD\nIdagold is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Coors Brewing Company in 1993. It is very late maturing\nand is short with stiff-straw. It has high test weight and good feed quality (digestibility). At the time of evaluation it was\nmoderately resistant to BYD and moderately susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1007 in the UC\nRegional Cereal Testing program from 1998-2000 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n\nIDAGOLD 2\nIdagold 2 is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Coors Brewing Company in 2001. Its experimental\ndesignation was C32. It is medium-late maturing (earlier maturing than Idagold) and is short with stiff-straw (height is\ncomparable to Idagold and its straw strength is as good as Idagold). It has better test weight than Idagold. It was\nevaluated as Entry 1074 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 2001 and in 2009 for spring planting in the\nintermountain region of northern California.\n\nJERSEY\nJersey is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Western Plant Breeders and Cebeco Seeds. It was selected\nfrom the cross Apex/Alexis. Its experimental designation was Cebeco 9538. It is late maturing and has mid-tall plant\nheight and fair straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to stripe rust and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry\n\n 21\n\f": {"entity 1": {"start": 0, "end": 10, "label": "PATH"}, "entity 2": {"start": 12, "end": 24, "label": "PATH"}, "entity 3": {"start": 29, "end": 32, "label":
