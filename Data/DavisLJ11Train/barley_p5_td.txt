TAMALPAIS
Tamalpais is a six-rowed spring hulless feed/food barley. It was released by the California AES in 2007. It was selected
from the cross Ataco/Achira//Higo x UC 960. Its experimental designation was UCD YP03-9/3. It is medium maturing,
medium-short height (averages about 32 inches in plant height), with good straw strength. It has full, rough awns and has
good resistance to shattering. Kernels are beige (non-blue, transparent aleurone which is classified as white). As a hulless
(naked) feed/food barley, Tamalpais should appeal to growers of organic barley for human consumption uses in
breakfast cereal and soups. Tamalpais is high in Beta-glucan (above 6%), a measure of soluble fiber, and may be useful
in lowering human cholesterol levels. Other markets include the bird seed and pet food industries. At the time of release
it was resistant to leaf rust and powdery mildew, moderately resistant to scald, net blotch, and BYD, and moderately
susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1134 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2004-present
for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal region of California.

UC 603
UC 603 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the University of California AES in 1988. It is a pure line
selection from the cross Mari/Luther//Traill/3/Briggs/Prato sib. Its experimental designation was UC80206. The cross
was intended to develop an early maturing, lodging resistant barley with net blotch and scald resistance. UC 603 has
medium short stature, good lodging resistance, and early maturity (about 1 day later than CM 72). The basal rachis
internode is curved. The rachis edges are covered with hairs. The spike is parallel, mid-dense, and inclined at maturity.
The lemma awn is long and rough. The glume awn is longer than the glume and is rough. The glume is longer than one-
half the length of the lemma. The rachilla has long hairs. Kernels are mid-long to long with semi-wrinkled hulls and
white aleurone. At the time of release, UC 603 was resistant to BYD (carries the Yd2 gene for resistance to BYD), and
resistant to moderately resistant to net blotch, scald, powdery mildew, and leaf rust. It subsequently became susceptible
to net blotch, moderately susceptible to stripe rust and leaf rust, and moderately resistant to BYD. It was evaluated as
Entry 603 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1984-present for late fall planting in the Central Valley and
the south-central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 30:1154-1155 (1990)

UC 933
UC 933 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 2001. It was selected from the cross
Sma1/Sunbar 401/3/Gus/Kombyne//Sma1. Sma1 has the parentage Steptoe/2*Diamant /3/Minn Dwarf 64.98-
8/Briggs/4/Asse. The final hybridization was made by Robert Matchett from whom segregating material was received in
1987. Subsequent generations were handled in a pedigree selection program. A final head row was selected by Lynn
Gallagher in 1992, bulked, and designated UCD 92-10,585 for preliminary yield trials. In 1994 it was designated UC 933
and placed into UC regional yield trials for statewide evaluation. UC 933 was released primarily for resistance to stripe
rust. UC 933 has spring growth habit, medium early maturity (heads 3-4 days earlier than UC 937 and about 4 days later
than UC 603), is medium height (about 1 inch shorter than UC 937 and one inch taller than UC 603), and has fair straw
strength (similar to UC 937 but inferior to UC 603). Spikes are fully awned, erect, and waxy. Glumes are completely
covered with long hairs. Glume awns are rough and equal in length to glumes. Lemma awns are long and rough. Kernels
are beige (non-blue aleurone), long, and slightly wrinkled. At the time of release UC 933 was resistant to scald, net
blotch, stripe rust, and leaf rust, and moderately resistant to BYD and powdery mildew. It subsequently became
susceptible to leaf rust. It was evaluated as Entry 933 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1995-present for
late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California and for spring planting in the
intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 43:437 (2003)

UC 960
UC 960 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 1999. UC 960 was selected among
the progeny from the hybrid Sma1/Sunbar 401/3/Gus/Kombyne//Sma1. Sma1 has the parentage
Steptoe/2*Diamant/3/Minn Dwarf 64.98-8/Briggs/4/Asse. The final hybridization was made at Woodland, CA in 1983
by Robert Matchett. Subsequent generations were handled in a pedigree selection program. An F3- derived seed sample
of NK 2867 (86Woodland 41017) was received in the F6 generation by the University of California from Robert
Matchett in 1987. A single head row was selected and bulked by Y. P. Puri in the 1987-88 growing season. NK 2867
was selected for agronomic appearance and resistance to barley stripe rust in 1995 at Tulelake, CA by Lynn Gallagher,
designated UC 960, and subsequently evaluated for grain yield in the northern intermountain areas of California from
1996 to 1998. UC 960 is intended primarily for spring planting in the southern Klamath Basin. UC 960 is short-statured
with excellent straw strength (similar to Gustoe for height, presumably as a result of the sdw gene either from Diamant or
Minn Dwarf 64.988). UC 960 is early maturing (about one week earlier than Gustoe and similar to Steptoe for time to
