moderately resistant to leaf rust and net blotch, and susceptible to BYD, scald, and powdery mildew. It was evaluated as
Entry 365 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-1984 and from 1988-1990 for late fall planting in the
Central Valley and south-central coastal regions of California.

SUNBAR BRAND 401
Sunbar Brand 401 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Northrup-King & Co. in 1980. It was selected
from the cross MINN 64-98-8/NU//CM67. Its experimental designation was NK214W. It has medium maturity, short
stature, very good straw strength and characteristics similar to Kombyne. It has white aleurone. At the time of evaluation
it was moderately resistant to net blotch, leaf rust, and BYD, moderately susceptible to powdery mildew, and susceptible
to scald. It was evaluated as Entry 466 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-1986 for late fall planting
in the Central Valley and south-central coastal regions of California.

SUNBAR BRAND 550
Sunbar Brand 550 is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Northrup-King & Co. It was evaluated as
Entry 634 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-1983 for spring planting in the intermountain region of
northern California.

SUNBAR BRAND 560
Sunbar Brand 560 is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Northrup-King & Co. It is medium maturing
and medium tall, with fair straw strength. It was evaluated as Entry 660 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from
1983-1987 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

SUNSTAR DOUBLE
Sunstar Double is a six-rowed facultative (winter/spring) feed barley. It was released by Sunderman Breeding Co. in
1995. It was selected from the cross Eight Twelve/Steptoe. Its experimental designation was SDM 208B. It has
intermediate height and good straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately resistant to BYD and
susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 950 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1995-1998 for
fall planting and spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

SUNSTAR PRINCE
Sunstar Prince is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Sunderman Breeding Co. in 1995. It was selected
from the cross Eight Twelve/Steptoe. Its experimental designation was SDM 306B. It has medium maturity, medium
height (several inches shorter than Steptoe) with fair straw strength (stronger straw than Steptoe). At the time of
evaluation it was susceptible to BYD and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 929 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing
program in 1994 and from 1996-1997 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

SUTTER
Sutter is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the University of California AES in 1971. It was selected
from the cross CIho 1237/2*Winter Tennessee. It is tall with moderately strong straw and long, medium-dense erect
heads. Early growth is semi-prostrate. It is late maturing (matures 4 days later than other cultivars grown in the Central
Valley of California at the time of release). It is rough awned and kernels are moderately large with colorless aleurone
and long rachilla with short hairs. It is similar to Winter Tennessee in ability to tolerate cold, wet soils. At the time of
evaluation it was resistant to BYD (carries the Yd2 gene from CIho 1237), and moderately resistant to scald, powdery
mildew, leaf rust and net blotch. It was evaluated as Entry 18 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-
1985 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal region of California. Crop Science 13:285

TANGO
Tango is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 2000. It was developed by molecular
marker assisted selection for quantitative trait loci (QTL) determining quantitative resistance to stripe rust. It was
selected from the cross Orca-sib/2*Steptoe. The source of stripe resistance is Calicuchima sib developed by the
ICARDA/CIMMYT Program in Mexico. Its experimental designations were SR58-4 and OR2967007. It is early
maturing, mid-tall, with fair straw strength (the same height, lodging reaction and maturity as Steptoe). Two cycles of
molecular marker-assisted backcrossing were used to transfer the resistance QTL alleles from BSR-41 to Steptoe. BSR-
41, a sister line of Orca, is Calicuchima-sib/Bowman. Tango has long and smooth awns, white aleurone and short
