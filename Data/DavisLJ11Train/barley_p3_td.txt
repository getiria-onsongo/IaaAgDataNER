the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California.

CONRAD
Conrad is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources in 2005. It was selected
from the cross B1215/B88-5336. Its experimental designation was 2B96-5057. It has consistently plump grain. It has
medium late maturity (heads about a half day earlier and matures about a half day later than B1202) and medium-tall
plant height (averages about 3 cm shorter than B1202 and about 5 cm shorter than Harrington). Straw strength is similar
to B1202 (fair). It has malt protein levels similar to Merit and Harrington, high levels of enzymes like Merit, and higher
levels of extract and better malt modification than B1202. At the time of release, its resistance to scald was similar to
B1202 and slightly better than Harrington (moderately susceptible), and its resistance to net blotch (net form) was
slightly better than B1202 and Harrington (moderately resistant). At the time of evaluation it was resistant to stripe rust.
It was evaluated as Entry 1082 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-02 and from 2005-present for
spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

ISHI
Ishi is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 2005. It was selected from the cross UC
828/UC 960. Its experimental designations were UC 1047 and UCD PYT99 A-13. Ishi has the sdw1 gene and is short
statured, averaging 84.6 cm, and is similar to UC 937 and 3.6 cm taller than UC 933, averaged over 32 location-years in
Central Valley and Central Coast environments. For lodging resistance (fair) it was superior to UC 937 but similar to UC
933 over 20 environments where lodging occurred. For days to heading it averaged 4 days earlier than UC 937 and 3
days later than UC 933, but all three cultivars were similar for time to maturity (medium late). It is heterogeneous for
rough and smooth awns, having less than one-percent smooth awned plants. The spike is waxy and semi-erect. The
kernels are covered and the aleurone is non-blue. Grains are long (>10mm) and wrinkled, with hairs on the ventral
furrow. Rachilla hairs are long. At the time of release Ishi was resistant to scald and powdery mildew, moderately
resistant to stripe rust, BYD and net blotch, and moderately susceptible to leaf rust. It subsequently became moderately
susceptible to net blotch. It was evaluated as Entry 1047 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2000-present
for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal region of California and for spring planting in the
intermountain area of northern California. Crop Science 46:1396 (2006)

MELTAN
Meltan is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was marketed by Adams Grain Company in California. Plants are late
maturing and moderately short (averaging about 32 inches in plant height) with fair straw strength. At the time of
evaluation it was resistant to leaf rust and powdery mildew, moderately resistant to stripe rust, and susceptible to scald,
net blotch and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 951 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1995 and from 2000-
present for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California.

MERIT 57
Merit 57 is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources in 2009. It was selected
from the backcross Merit//Merit/2B94-5744 made in 1996 in Fort Collins, Colorado. It has high levels of enzymes, Î±-
amylase and diastatic power, similar to the cultivar Merit. Overall malting profile is equivalent to or superior to Merit,
with complete and balanced modification and superior levels of malt extract. Merit 57 is rough awned and late maturing,
with high yield potential. It has intermediate plant height and straw strength, and slightly better lodging resistance than
AC Metcalfe. It has good resistance to shattering and fair to good tolerance of straw breakage and drought. Merit 57 has
denser pubescence on the blade of the flag leaf than Merit. The anthocyanin coloration of the flag leaf auricles is weaker
than Merit. The spike emergence is earlier than Merit. The tips of the lemma awns of Merit 57 have weaker anthocyanin
coloration than Harrington. Merit 57 has a laxer spike than Merit. The spike is shorter than Merit and Harrington. The
basal marking on the kernel of Merit 57 is horseshoe shaped while it is transverse creased in Harrington. Merit 57 has a
longer kernel than Harrington. Merit 57 has better scald resistance than Merit. At the time of release Merit 57 was
moderately susceptible to scald, net blotch, race MCC of stem rust, and spot blotch, and susceptible to BYD. It was
evaluated as Entry 1299 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2011-present for spring planting in the
intermountain region of northern California.

MILLENNIUM
Millennium is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Utah AES in 2000. It was selected from the cross
WA Sel 3564/Unitan//UT Short2*2. Its experimental designations were UT94B1058-4603 and UT 4603. Millennium is
