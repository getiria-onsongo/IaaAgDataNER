STATEHOOD
Statehood is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station in 1997. It was
selected from the cross WA641566/Bracken. Its experimental designation was UT1705-D. It has early to midseason
maturity and is erect-growing, medium height, and has good straw strength. It has a tapering, dense head with no overlap
of lateral kernels, short hairs on the rachis edges, and waxy leaves and heads. Glumes are long with short hairs restricted
to the middle, and have long, semi-smooth glume awns. Lemma awns are long and wrinkled with numerous long rachilla
hairs and a transverse crease at the base. Aleurone color is white and 1000-kernel weight averages 43 g. The base of
most spikes is marked by a closed collar. At the time of release it was resistant to loose smut and covered smut,
moderately resistant to powdery mildew, and susceptible to stripe rust and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 1016 in the
UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1991 and from 1998-2011 for spring planting in the intermountain region of
northern California. Crop Science 40:1507-1508 (2000)

STOCKFORD
Stockford is a two-rowed hooded spring forage barley. It was released by WestBred LLC. It is medium maturing, tall
with fair straw strength, and produces a high yielding, high quality and uniform hay crop. It has a fine stems which aids
in feeding and digestibility. At the time of release it was moderately susceptible to stripe rust and susceptible to scald, net
blotch, and BYD. It is adapted for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

SUMMIT
Summit is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by North American Plant Breeders in 1977. It was selected
from the cross HP1203*(Zephyr*Tern). It has mid-season maturity and is medium short (1-3 inches shorter than Klages
and Steptoe) and has strong straw. Awns are long and rough. Glumes have short hairs that are confined to the midline of
the glume. Hulls are adhering. Aleurone is colorless. Rachilla hairs are short. There are no barbs on lateral veins. The
crease is closed in the lower one-third of the kernel and flared at the awn end. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to
powdery mildew, moderately resistant to common root rot, and susceptible to net blotch and spot blotch. It was evaluated
as Entry 580 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1981-1984 for spring planting in the intermountain region
of northern California.

SUNBAR 458
Sunbar 458 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Northrup-King & Co. in 1989. Its experimental
designations were NK80W41558 and NK41558. It is medium late maturing and medium tall, with good straw strength.
At the time of evaluation it was resistant to powdery mildew, moderately resistant to leaf rust and net blotch, moderately
susceptible to scald, and susceptible to BYD and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 647 in the UC Regional Cereal
Testing program from 1983-1984 and from 1989-1997 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central
coastal regions of California.

SUNBAR BARLEY BLEND 82-2
Sunbar Barley Blend 82-2 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Northrup-King & Co. in 1983. It is a
50/50 blend of NK41248 (SB425) and NK31275. NK41248 has medium maturity, excellent straw strength, and white
seed with medium test weight. NK41248 is slightly later than NK31275, has slightly taller, weaker straw, white seed and
medium test weight. The chief contribution of NK31275 to the blend is its higher yield potential. Sunbar Barley Blend
82-2 is short statured, stiff-strawed (good lodging resistance), with medium-late maturity. Kernels are white with
medium test weight. At the time of evaluation Sunbar Barley Blend 82-2 was resistant to moderately resistant to BYD,
scald, and net blotch, and moderately susceptible to powdery mildew and leaf rust. It was evaluated as Entry 584 in the
UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-1993 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and south-central
coastal regions of California.

SUNBAR BRAND 400
Sunbar Brand 400 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Northrup-King & Co. in 1980. Sunbar Brand 400
has short stature, medium strong straw, and medium maturity. The basal rachis internode is straight. Rachis edges have
few hairs. The spike is parallel, lax, and inclined at maturity. The lemma awn is long and semi-smooth. The glume awn
is equal in length to the glume, and is semi-smooth. The glume is one-half the length of the lemma. Rachilla hairs are
short. Kernels are long with slightly wrinkled hulls and white aleurone. At the time of evaluation, Sunbar Brand 400 was
