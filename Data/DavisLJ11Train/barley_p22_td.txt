northern California.

KARL
Karl is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES in 1974. It was selected
from the cross Traill//Good Delta/Everest/3/Traill. Its experimental designation was 63Ab2987. It has midseason
maturity. It has superior lodging resistance, is 7-10 cm shorter and heads 2-3 days earlier than Traill. It is more
susceptible to shattering than Steveland. Spikes are lax, mid-long to long with rough awns and short rachilla hairs. The
aleurone is white and the hull is adhering and wrinkled, with few to several barbs occurring on moderately prominent
lateral veins. The central vein of the kernel is prominent. The crease is shallow, relatively narrow, closed at the base and
flaring toward the awn end. The glume is covered with short hairs. It has good test weight and kernel weight when grown
under irrigation in southern Idaho. At the time of release it was susceptible to covered and loose smut and powdery
mildew. It was evaluated as Entry 360 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1980 for spring planting in the
intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 16:737 (1976)

KARLA
Karla is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES in 1981. It was selected
from the cross 63Ab2987-9/2*Conquest. 63Ab2987-9 is a sister selection of Karl. Its experimental designation was
74Ab4302. It is intended as a replacement for Karl. It has midseason maturity. It heads 3 days later, is similar test
weight, and has lower kernel plumpness than Steptoe. It is mid-tall (averages 3 inches taller than Steptoe) and has
superior lodging resistance compared to Steptoe. It yields 93-97% of Steptoe in irrigated and dryland trials. Spikes are
semi-erect, lax, mid-long to long with smooth awns. Rachis edges are smooth. Glumes have relatively short hairs
confined to the midline of the glume. Kernels have long rachilla hairs and white aleurone. Hulls are adhering and
wrinkled. Lateral veins are moderately prominent with few barbs. The crease is relatively narrow, closed at the base and
flaring toward the awn end. Lateral kernels are moderately twisted. At the time of release it was susceptible to powdery
mildew and bacterial leaf streak. It was evaluated as Entry 628 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-
1985 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 25:570 (1985)

KLAGES
Klages is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by USDA-ARS and the Idaho and Oregon AESs in 1973. It
was selected from the cross Betzes/Domen. It is a composite of 35 F11 lines selected from the bulk population
designated 60Ab1810. The line 60Ab1810 was derived from an F3 selection made at Aberdeen in 1960. Klages has mid-
season maturity and is medium tall with stiff straw. The basal rachis internode is curved. Rachis edges are covered with
hairs. The spike is parallel, lax, and nodding at maturity. The lemma awn is long and rough. The glume awn is more than
equal in length to the glume and is rough. The glume is one-half the length of the lemma and is covered with long hairs.
Rachilla hairs are long. Kernels are mid-long with wrinkled hulls with weakly developed barbless veins and white
aleurone. The crease is narrow and shallow at the base, flaring toward the awn end. It is susceptible to BYD, scald and
stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 209 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-1996 for spring planting
in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 14: 337-338 (1974)

KOMBAR
Kombar is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Northrup-King & Co. in 1975. It was selected from the
cross Minn.64-98-8/2*Briggs. Its experimental designation was Exp. 314. It is adapted for irrigated conditions in
California and Arizona. It is higher yielding than Briggs and CM67. It has semi-smooth awns and midseason to late
maturity. It is mid-tall with stiff, strong straw. Spikes are lax, mid-long and strongly inclined at maturity. Rachis edges
are covered with hairs. Kernels are mid-long, white with slightly wrinkled hulls, and colorless aleurone. Rachilla hairs
are short. Veins are prominent and there are no or few barbs on lateral veins. The crease is closed in the lower two-thirds
and moderately flared at the awn end. Lateral kernels are moderately twisted. At the time of release it had field tolerance
to BYD and was susceptible to scald. It subsequently became susceptible to net blotch. It was evaluated as Entry 231 in
the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-1981 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-
central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 16:738 (1976)

KOMBYNE
Kombyne a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Northrup-King & Co. in 1975. It was selected from the
cross Minnesota 64-98-8/Numar//CM 67. Its experimental designation was Exp. 214. It has higher yields than UC 566,
