It was evaluated as Entry 745 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1989-\n1991 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 26:1079 (1986)\n\nCRAFT\nCraft is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by the Montana AES in 2004. It was selected from the cross\nKlages/Baronesse. Its experimental designation was MT 970116. It was bred to incorporate the excellent flavor profile\nand malting characteristics of the variety Klages into a high yielding cultivar capable of competing with today\u2019s malting\nand feed cultivars. It has medium early maturity, tall plant height, and fair to poor straw strength. It was evaluated as\nEntry 1195 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2006-2007 for spring planting in the intermountain region\nof northern California.\n\nCREEL\nCreel is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed cooperatively by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES and\nreleased in 2005. It was selected from the cross M44/80Ab4952//79Ab10719. Its experimental designation was\n93Ab688. It is best adapted to rainfed production areas in Idaho and eastern Oregon, and has good production under\nirrigation in southeastern Idaho. Creel has early to mid-season maturity (similar in heading to Colter). It is mid-tall (3 cm\nshorter than Colter) and lodges more than Colter. It has medium-lax spikes, smooth awns, and long rachilla hairs.\nKernels are covered and have white aleurone. Creel's kernel plumpness is equal to Colter but 6% less than Morex under\nirrigation at Aberdeen. At the time of release, Creel was moderately susceptible to BYD, net blotch, and scald, and\nsusceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1079 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-2009 for\nspring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 46:1812 (2006)\n\nCREST\nCrest is a two-rowed spring malting and feed barley. It was released by Washington State University and Idaho and\nOregon AESs in 1992. It was selected from the cross Klages/2 WA8537-68. Its experimental designation was WA 8771-\n78. It is widely adapted, with highest relative yield in areas where rainfall is less than 450 mm. It has midseason maturity\n(two days earlier than Klages), medium height (similar to Klages), and is susceptible to lodging. Spikes are lax and\nnodding, awns are long and rough. Kernels are mid-long and plump. Hulls are slightly wrinkled and adhering. Veins are\nprominent and the crease is narrow to broad. Rachilla hairs are long. The aleurone is white. It has good malting and\nnutritional quality. At the time of release it had partial resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust and was susceptible\nto Russian wheat aphid. It was evaluated as Entry 902 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1993-1995 for\nspring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 32:1506-1507 (1992)\n\nCRITON\nCriton is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Idaho AES in 2002. It was selected from the cross\nGallatin/Targhee//Bowman. Its experimental designation was 91Ab3148. It is early maturing, has tall plant height, and is\nsusceptible to lodging. At the time of release it was moderately susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1078\nin the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-2004 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern\nCalifornia.\n\nCRYSTAL\nCrystal is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was developed cooperatively by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES and\nreleased by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho and Oregon AESs in 1989. It was selected from the cross Columba/Klages. Its\nexperimental designation was 78Ab6871. It has midseason maturity and is mid-tall (similar to Klages) with poor straw\nstrength. Spikes are lax, mid-long to long, with rough awns. Rachilla hairs are long. Glumes are covered with long hairs.\nThe hull is adhering and wrinkled. Aleurone is white. It has moderately prominent lateral veins. The central vein is not\nwell defined. There are no barbs on lateral veins. The crease is narrow at the base and flared toward the beard end.\nMalting quality is acceptable, similar to Klages. Kernel color retention is good. At the time of release it was susceptible\nto stripe rust and had good field tolerance to kernel blight. It was evaluated as Entry 657 in the UC Regional Cereal\nTesting program from 1983-1984, in 1987, and from 1989-1995 for spring planting in the intermountain region of\nnorthern California. Crop Science 31:481 (1991)\n\nDRUMMOND\nDrummond is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by the North Dakota AES in 2000. It was selected from\nthe cross Hazen*2/WPG821/4/Stander/3/Bumper/Hazen//Azure. Its experimental designation was ND15477.
