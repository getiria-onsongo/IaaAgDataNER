It was released by the Minnesota AES in 1974. It was selected from the\ncross Cree/4/Parkland *2/NDB112/3/Vantage//Kindred/Jotun. Its experimental designation was M16. It is medium-early\nmaturing, mid-tall, and has moderately strong straw. Spikes are rough-awned, medium-lax, long and semi-erect. Kernels\nare covered, medium sized with short-haired rachilla and white aleurone. It has more kernels per spike, fewer tillers and\nlower tiller mortality than Larker. It is adapted to the Red River Valley of Minnesota. At the time of release it was\nresistant to stem rust and spot blotch. It was evaluated as Entry 581 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from\n1980-1984 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 15:603 (1975)\n\nMARANNA\nMaranna is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Oregon, Idaho, and Washington AESs in 1993. It was\nselected from the cross OSB74133/M33. Its experimental designation was ORS-2. It has very high yield potential under\nirrigated or high rainfall conditions with high inputs. It is several days later in heading than Steptoe, short statured\n(average height of 68 cm), and resistant to lodging. It has smooth awns and white aleurone. Spikes are semi-lax. At the\ntime of release it was susceptible to stripe rust and to the Russian wheat aphid. It was evaluated as Entry 854 in the UC\nRegional Cereal Testing program from 1991-1997 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.\nCrop Science 35:1504 (1995)\n\nMAX\nMax is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Farmers Marketing Corporation in 1992 and is distributed by\nWorld Wide Wheat. It was selected from a male-sterile facilitated recurrent selection population (CCXXXII). Its\nexperimental designation was FMC 7024. It is late maturing with short stature and fair lodging resistance. At the time of\nevaluation it was resistant to BYD, moderately susceptible to leaf rust and susceptible to scald, powdery mildew, net\nblotch and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 816 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1990-2011 for late\nfall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California.\n\nMENTOR\nMentor is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was received for testing from Lynn Gallagher, UC Davis, in 1999. It is\nlate maturing and has medium plant height and fair to poor straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately\nsusceptible to BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 1036 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1999 for spring\nplanting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n\nMENUET\nMenuet is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by CENEX, Oregon. It is medium maturing (heads about 7\ndays later than Steptoe, similar to Clark) and medium height (it averages about 3 inches shorter than Steptoe or Klages\nunder irrigated conditions) and has fair straw strength (less lodging than Klages). It has high test weight. At the time of\nevaluation it was resistant to leaf rust and susceptible to scald and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 699 in the UC\nRegional Cereal Testing program from 1985-1987 for spring planting in the intermountain area of northern California\nand for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California.\n\nMERIT\nMerit is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources. It was selected from the\ncross Manley/2B80-350. Its experimental designation was BA 2B91-4947. It is medium late maturing, mid-tall and has\npoor straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to net blotch and leaf rust, moderately resistant to BYD,\nand susceptible to scald and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 977 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from\n1997-1998, from 2001-2006, and in 2011 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n\nMICAH\nMicah is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It is late maturing, short, and has fair straw strength. It was evaluated as Entry\n772 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1987-1991 for spring planting in the intermountain region of\nnorthern California.\n\nMORAVIAN 14\nMoravian 14 is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Coors Brewing Company in 1991. It was selected\n\n 25\n\f": {"entity 1": {"start": 7, "end": 13, "label": "CVAR"}, "entity 2": {"start": 19, "end": 28, "label": "TRAT"}, "entity 3": {"start": 29, "end": 35, "label": "TRAT"},
