TARGHEE
Targhee is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho, Oregon, and Washington
AESs in 1991. It was selected from the cross 60Ab1810-53/Hector = Betzes/Domen//Hector. Its experimental
designation was 78Ab10099-B. It is meant primarily for rainfed conditions and is susceptible to lodging under irrigation.

Lemmas are typically wrinkled and glumes are covered with hairs. At the time of evaluation it was susceptible to stripe
rust. It was evaluated as Entry 901 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1993-1995 for spring planting in the
intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 35:1209-1210 (1995)

X1275/Sunbar 458//Gloria ‘S’/Copal ‘S’. Its experimental designation was RSI 212. It is medium early maturing and
medium height with fair straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately resistant to scald, BYD, leaf rust and
powdery mildew, moderately susceptible to net blotch and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 890 in the
UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1993-1996 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central
coastal regions of California.

TRADITION
Tradition is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources in 2003. It was selected
from the cross 6B89-2126/ND10981. Its experimental designation was 6B95-2482. Plants are tall with fair lodging
resistance and early maturity. It has semi-smooth awns, long rachilla hairs, and colorless aleurone. It is resistant to spot
blotch and has slightly better net blotch resistance than Robust. At the time of evaluation it was susceptible to scald,
BYD, and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1083 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-2006 and in
2011 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

TRIUMPH
Triumph is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It originated in the German Democratic Republic and was released in
1976. It was selected from the cross Diamant/St. 1402964-9. It has midseason maturity, short to medium tall plants and
strong straw. Spikes are narrow, medium length, medium lax to medium dense, and nodding. Awns are rough. Glumes
have long hairs and the glume awn is equal in length to the glume. Hulls are wrinkled and aleurone is colorless. Rachilla
hairs are long. Veins are moderately prominent and there are no barbs on lateral veins. The crease is deep with defined
folds, well defined at the center and flared at the tip. Kernels are plump, and long in relation to width. At the time of
evaluation it was resistant to stripe rust and scald, and susceptible to powdery mildew. It was evaluated as Entry 804 in
the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1989-1990 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern
California.
