are covered, medium sized with short-haired rachilla and white aleurone. It has more kernels per spike, fewer tillers and
lower tiller mortality than Larker. It is adapted to the Red River Valley of Minnesota. At the time of release it was
resistant to stem rust and spot blotch. It was evaluated as Entry 581 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from
1980-1984 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 15:603 (1975)

selected from the cross OSB74133/M33. Its experimental designation was ORS-2. It has very high yield potential under
irrigated or high rainfall conditions with high inputs. It is several days later in heading than Steptoe, short statured
(average height of 68 cm), and resistant to lodging. It has smooth awns and white aleurone. Spikes are semi-lax. At the
time of release it was susceptible to stripe rust and to the Russian wheat aphid. It was evaluated as Entry 854 in the UC

poor straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to net blotch and leaf rust, moderately resistant to BYD,
and susceptible to scald and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 977 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from
1997-1998, from 2001-2006, and in 2011 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.
