The following are descriptions of barley cultivars evaluated in California from 1981 to 2011. The descriptions are based
on published cultivar releases and data from the UC Regional Cereal Evaluation Tests conducted each year throughout
California. Yield performance data for most of the cultivars can be found in University of California, Davis, Agronomy
Progress Reports (No.'s 118, 128, 144, 155, 168, 180, 201,209, 217, 223, 229, 233, 236, 244, 249, 254, 259, 262, 265,
272, 276, 279, 286, 288, 290, 293, 295, 296, 301, 303, 304 for 1980-2011, respectively). Reports #262 through 304 also
can be seen at http://smallgrains.ucdavis.edu.

CURRENT CULTIVARS
WINTER BARLEY

EIGHT-TWELVE
Eight-Twelve is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES in 1991. It was
selected from the cross Steveland/Luther//Wintermalt. Its experimental designation was 79Ab812. It has rough awns,
midseason maturity, good winter hardiness, and is medium height with intermediate lodging resistance. Spikes are short
and dense. Kernels have white aleurone and short rachilla hairs. It is susceptible to stripe rust, scald, and snow mold, and
moderately susceptible to BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 697 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-
2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 32(3):828 (1992)

MAJA
Maja is a six-rowed winter feed/malt barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 2006 and licensed to AgriSource
(Burley, Idaho). It is a doubled haploid developed from the F1 of the cross of Strider/88Ab536. Its experimental
designation was STAB 113. Maja, like the 88Ab536 parent, is a facultative cultivar: it has a “winter” allele at the Vrn-
H1 locus on chromosome 5H but lacks the repressor encoded by the Vrn-H2 locus on 4H. This configuration of
vernalization genes can lead to early maturity under some environmental conditions, and this feature could be an
advantage in terms of flexibility in planting date, irrigation savings, and drought avoidance. It is a standard height
selection (averages about 42 inches in plant height, with fair straw strength) with rough awns and a semi-compact spike.
The grain has white aleurone. Maja has high test weight and showed promise as malting barley in repeated micro-
malting tests, but it was ultimately not approved by the American Malting Barley Association (AMBA). It has a lower
grain protein and enzyme level than is desired for production of lighter beers. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to
stripe rust and susceptible to scald. It was evaluated as Entry 1129 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from
2001-2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Oregon AES (2006)

STRIDER
Strider is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 1997. It is a doubled-haploid line
produced from the cross I1162-19/J-126//WA1245///Steptoe. Its experimental designation was ORW-6. It is medium
height (averages about 41 inches, slightly taller than Kold) and medium early maturing with fair straw strength. It has
rough awns and a semi-compact spike. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to stripe rust and moderately susceptible
to scald, net blotch, and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 964 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1997-
2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California and in 2008 for fall planting in the Central
Valley of California. Oregon AES (1997)
