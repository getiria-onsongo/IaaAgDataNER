moderately susceptible to BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 745 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1989-
1991 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 26:1079 (1986)

CRAFT
Craft is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by the Montana AES in 2004. It was selected from the cross
Klages/Baronesse. Its experimental designation was MT 970116. It was bred to incorporate the excellent flavor profile
and malting characteristics of the variety Klages into a high yielding cultivar capable of competing with todayâ€™s malting
and feed cultivars. It has medium early maturity, tall plant height, and fair to poor straw strength. It was evaluated as
Entry 1195 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2006-2007 for spring planting in the intermountain region
of northern California.

CREEL
Creel is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed cooperatively by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES and
released in 2005. It was selected from the cross M44/80Ab4952//79Ab10719. Its experimental designation was
93Ab688. It is best adapted to rainfed production areas in Idaho and eastern Oregon, and has good production under
irrigation in southeastern Idaho. Creel has early to mid-season maturity (similar in heading to Colter). It is mid-tall (3 cm
shorter than Colter) and lodges more than Colter. It has medium-lax spikes, smooth awns, and long rachilla hairs.
Kernels are covered and have white aleurone. Creel's kernel plumpness is equal to Colter but 6% less than Morex under
irrigation at Aberdeen. At the time of release, Creel was moderately susceptible to BYD, net blotch, and scald, and
susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1079 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-2009 for
spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 46:1812 (2006)

CREST
Crest is a two-rowed spring malting and feed barley. It was released by Washington State University and Idaho and
Oregon AESs in 1992. It was selected from the cross Klages/2 WA8537-68. Its experimental designation was WA 8771-
78. It is widely adapted, with highest relative yield in areas where rainfall is less than 450 mm. It has midseason maturity
(two days earlier than Klages), medium height (similar to Klages), and is susceptible to lodging. Spikes are lax and
nodding, awns are long and rough. Kernels are mid-long and plump. Hulls are slightly wrinkled and adhering. Veins are
prominent and the crease is narrow to broad. Rachilla hairs are long. The aleurone is white. It has good malting and
nutritional quality. At the time of release it had partial resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust and was susceptible
to Russian wheat aphid. It was evaluated as Entry 902 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1993-1995 for
spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 32:1506-1507 (1992)

CRITON
Criton is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Idaho AES in 2002. It was selected from the cross
Gallatin/Targhee//Bowman. Its experimental designation was 91Ab3148. It is early maturing, has tall plant height, and is
susceptible to lodging. At the time of release it was moderately susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1078
in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-2004 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern
California.

CRYSTAL
Crystal is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was developed cooperatively by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES and
released by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho and Oregon AESs in 1989. It was selected from the cross Columba/Klages. Its
experimental designation was 78Ab6871. It has midseason maturity and is mid-tall (similar to Klages) with poor straw
strength. Spikes are lax, mid-long to long, with rough awns. Rachilla hairs are long. Glumes are covered with long hairs.
The hull is adhering and wrinkled. Aleurone is white. It has moderately prominent lateral veins. The central vein is not
well defined. There are no barbs on lateral veins. The crease is narrow at the base and flared toward the beard end.
Malting quality is acceptable, similar to Klages. Kernel color retention is good. At the time of release it was susceptible
to stripe rust and had good field tolerance to kernel blight. It was evaluated as Entry 657 in the UC Regional Cereal
Testing program from 1983-1984, in 1987, and from 1989-1995 for spring planting in the intermountain region of
northern California. Crop Science 31:481 (1991)

DRUMMOND
Drummond is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by the North Dakota AES in 2000. It was selected from
the cross Hazen*2/WPG821/4/Stander/3/Bumper/Hazen//Azure. Its experimental designation was ND15477. Drummond
