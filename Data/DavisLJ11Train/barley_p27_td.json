It was developed by Wilbur-Ellis Co. It is early maturing with medium height\nand poor straw strength. It was evaluated as Entry 724 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1985 for spring\nplanting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n\nNUMAR\nNumar is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 1966. It was selected from the cross\nCalifornia Mariout *4/Arivat. Its experimental designation was UCD 1520. It is adapted to the San Joaquin and Imperial\nValleys and Southern California. It is similar to California Mariout but 2 days later in maturity, slightly taller, and has\nappreciably stiffer straw. It is equal or superior to both parents in yield. It is smooth awned and early maturing. It has\nshort stiff straw and medium-dense erect spikes. Kernels are large with medium to dark blue aleurone and long-haired\nrachillas. At the time of evaluation it was moderately resistant to net blotch and susceptible to scald. It was evaluated as\nEntry 3 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-81 for late fall planting in the Central Valley, the south-\ncentral coastal region, and Southern California. Crop Science 8:776 (1968)\n\nORCA\nOrca is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 1998. It was selected from the cross\nCalicuchima-sib/Bowman-derivative. It is one of 110 doubled haploid lines derived from the F1 of Calicuchima-\nsib/Bowman-derivative. The doubled haploids were developed by the Hordeum bulbosum technique. Its experimental\ndesignations were BSR 45 and Icaro. It has quantitative resistance to barley stripe rust and BYD. Quantitative trait loci\n(QTLs) determining resistance to barley stripe rust were mapped on chromosomes 4 (4H) and 7 (5H). Resistance to BYD\nis conditioned by the Yd2 gene on chromosome 3 (3H). It is early maturing and medium height with good straw strength.\nIt has rough-awns, white-aleurone, and short rachilla hair. It has very plump grain, high test weight, and an acceptable\nyield record under irrigated conditions and under dryland conditions where earliness is an advantage. It has a novel\nquality profile of high starch content, high enzymes, and low beta glucan. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to\nstripe rust, moderately resistant to BYD, and susceptible to leaf rust. It was evaluated as Entry 976 in the UC Regional\nCereal Testing program from 1997-2005 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop\nScience 40:849-850 (2000)\n\nOTHELLO\nOthello is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES. It was selected from the cross\nHarrington/Orca//D172 (Shyri/Galena). Its experimental designations were OR2967102 and BCD 47. It is late maturing\nand short-statured with fair straw strength. At the time of release it was resistant to stripe rust and susceptible to BYD. It\nwas evaluated as Entry 1013 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1998-2004 for spring planting in the\nintermountain region of northern California.\n\nPATTI\nPatti is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Farmers Marketing Corporation and released in 1998 and is\ndistributed by World-Wide Wheat. It was selected from a male-sterile facilitated recurrent selection population\n(CCXXXII 78). Its experimental designation was FMC 8055. It is medium-early maturing and short-statured with good\nstraw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately resistant to net blotch and BYD, moderately susceptible to\nstripe rust, and susceptible to scald and leaf rust. It was evaluated as Entry 885 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing\nprogram from 1993-2006 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south- central coastal region of California.\n\nPENBAR\nPenbar is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Resource Seeds, Inc. in 1997. It was selected from the cross\nSMA/4161//1248/3/CIN/2505/4/X1275. Its experimental designation was RSI 32306. It is medium maturing and\nmedium-short with fair straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to net blotch and powdery mildew,\nmoderately resistant to scald, BYD, and leaf rust, and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 919 in the UC\nRegional Cereal Testing program from 1994-1997 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central\ncoastal regions of California.\n\nPISTON\n\n
