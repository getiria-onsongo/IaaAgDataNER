BOB
Bob is a two-rowed spring malting and feed barley. It was released by the Washington State University Agriculture
Research Center in cooperation with the Idaho and Oregon Agricultural Experiment Stations, and USDA-ARS in 2002.
It was selected from the cross A308 (Lewis somaclonal line)/Baronesse. Its experimental designation was WA8682-96.
It has midseason maturity, medium plant height (about 3 cm taller than Baronesse), fair straw strength, lax nodding
spikes, rough long awns, and plump white kernels with long rachilla hairs. It has mixed deficiens-wild type head types at
a ratio of about 44%/56%. It was widely adapted across eastern Washington and in general across Idaho and Oregon.
Yield averages 98% of Baronesse in eastern Washington. Test weight and kernel plumpness average 90% and 85%,
respectively, of Baronesse. Maturity is 1 day later than Baronesse. Malting quality is comparable to Harrington, based
on 4-year average. At the time of release it was moderately resistant to leaf rust, moderately susceptible to stripe rust,
and with unknown reaction to other diseases. It was evaluated as Entry 1097 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program
from 2002-2004 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 43:1132-1133

BOWMAN
Bowman is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the North Dakota AES in cooperation with the USDA-
ARS in 1984. It was selected from the cross Klages//Fergus/Nordic/3/ND1156/4/Hector. Its experimental designation
was ND 4994. It has early maturity, medium height, and moderately strong straw. Spikes are medium-long, medium-lax
and semi-erect. Awns are smooth. Seeds are very plump with white aleurone. Test weight is high. At the time of release
it was resistant to stem rust and susceptible to leaf rust, BYD and loose smut. It was evaluated as Entry 689 in the UC
Regional Cereal Testing program from 1984-1985 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

BRIGGS
Briggs is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 1966. It is a pure line selection from
the backcross 2*California Mariout/Arivat. Its experimental designation was UCD 27. Briggs is adapted to the
Sacramento Valley and Coastal area of California. It is similar to Arivat in many characteristics. It has short stature, but
relatively weak straw compared to more recently released cultivars, and early maturity. Collars are closed and the basal
rachis internode is straight. The spike is parallel, lax, and nodding at maturity. The lemma awn is long and semi-smooth.
The glume awn is equal in length to the glume and is semi-rough. The glume is half the length of the lemma. Rachilla
hairs are long. Kernels are long with slightly wrinkled hulls and white aleurone. At the time of release, Briggs was
moderately resistant to scald, leaf rust and powdery mildew, and susceptible to BYD and net blotch. It was evaluated as
Entry 2 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-1994 for late fall planting, particularly in the Central
Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 8:776 (1968)

BRIGHAM
Brigham is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Utah AES in 1998. It was selected from the cross
Woodvale//Primus/SD67-297/3/Steptoe/4/UT Short #1. Its experimental designations were UT90B772-2120 and
UT002120. Brigham is an erect-growing semi-dwarf with early maturity. Spikes are erect (lax to dense) with essentially
no overlap of lateral kernels and rachis edges covered with short hairs. Brigham has waxy leaves and slightly waxy
spikes. Glumes are medium length and essentially covered with long hairs and have medium-length, semi-rough glume
awns. Lemma awns are widely long, flaring, and semi-rough. The seed is covered, mid-long, slightly wrinkled, with long
rachilla hairs and a slight crease at the base. Aleurone color is white. Most stems have a snaky shaped neck and most
spikes are marked by a closed collar at the base. Brigham is recommended for production under irrigation. At the time of
evaluation it was resistant to loose smut and covered smut, moderately resistant to BYD, moderately susceptible to
powdery mildew, and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1009 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing
program from 1998-2003 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 42:666

CALIBER
Caliber is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by World-Wide Wheat. It was selected from a male-sterile
facilitated recurrent selection population (CCXXXII-78). Its experimental designation was BA 2139. It has medium late
maturity, medium plant height, and fair straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately susceptible to scald,
net blotch, and leaf rust, and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 983 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing
