the Central Valley and south-central coastal regions of California.

NOVA
Nova is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Wilbur-Ellis Co. It is early maturing with medium height
and poor straw strength. It was evaluated as Entry 724 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1985 for spring
planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

NUMAR
Numar is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 1966. It was selected from the cross
California Mariout *4/Arivat. Its experimental designation was UCD 1520. It is adapted to the San Joaquin and Imperial
Valleys and Southern California. It is similar to California Mariout but 2 days later in maturity, slightly taller, and has
appreciably stiffer straw. It is equal or superior to both parents in yield. It is smooth awned and early maturing. It has
short stiff straw and medium-dense erect spikes. Kernels are large with medium to dark blue aleurone and long-haired
rachillas. At the time of evaluation it was moderately resistant to net blotch and susceptible to scald. It was evaluated as
Entry 3 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-81 for late fall planting in the Central Valley, the south-
central coastal region, and Southern California. Crop Science 8:776 (1968)

ORCA
Orca is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 1998. It was selected from the cross
Calicuchima-sib/Bowman-derivative. It is one of 110 doubled haploid lines derived from the F1 of Calicuchima-
sib/Bowman-derivative. The doubled haploids were developed by the Hordeum bulbosum technique. Its experimental
designations were BSR 45 and Icaro. It has quantitative resistance to barley stripe rust and BYD. Quantitative trait loci
(QTLs) determining resistance to barley stripe rust were mapped on chromosomes 4 (4H) and 7 (5H). Resistance to BYD
is conditioned by the Yd2 gene on chromosome 3 (3H). It is early maturing and medium height with good straw strength.
It has rough-awns, white-aleurone, and short rachilla hair. It has very plump grain, high test weight, and an acceptable
yield record under irrigated conditions and under dryland conditions where earliness is an advantage. It has a novel
quality profile of high starch content, high enzymes, and low beta glucan. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to
stripe rust, moderately resistant to BYD, and susceptible to leaf rust. It was evaluated as Entry 976 in the UC Regional
Cereal Testing program from 1997-2005 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop
Science 40:849-850 (2000)

OTHELLO
Othello is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES. It was selected from the cross
Harrington/Orca//D172 (Shyri/Galena). Its experimental designations were OR2967102 and BCD 47. It is late maturing
and short-statured with fair straw strength. At the time of release it was resistant to stripe rust and susceptible to BYD. It
was evaluated as Entry 1013 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1998-2004 for spring planting in the
intermountain region of northern California.

PATTI
Patti is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was developed by Farmers Marketing Corporation and released in 1998 and is
distributed by World-Wide Wheat. It was selected from a male-sterile facilitated recurrent selection population
(CCXXXII 78). Its experimental designation was FMC 8055. It is medium-early maturing and short-statured with good
straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately resistant to net blotch and BYD, moderately susceptible to
stripe rust, and susceptible to scald and leaf rust. It was evaluated as Entry 885 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing
program from 1993-2006 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south- central coastal region of California.

PENBAR
Penbar is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Resource Seeds, Inc. in 1997. It was selected from the cross
SMA/4161//1248/3/CIN/2505/4/X1275. Its experimental designation was RSI 32306. It is medium maturing and
medium-short with fair straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to net blotch and powdery mildew,
moderately resistant to scald, BYD, and leaf rust, and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 919 in the UC
Regional Cereal Testing program from 1994-1997 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central
coastal regions of California.
