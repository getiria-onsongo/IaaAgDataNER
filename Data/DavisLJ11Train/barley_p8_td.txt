selected from the cross BÃ¶re/Hudson. Its experimental designation was WA 2084-63. It was bred to replace Hudson in
the winter barley areas of eastern Washington. It is more lodging resistant, 6 cm shorter and similar in winterhardiness
compared to Hudson. It is rough-awned, mid-tall and early maturing. The spike is semi-dense and kernels are medium
size and plump. The aleurone is light blue and rachillas are short haired. At the time of evaluation it was moderately
resistant to scald and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 129 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program
in 1982, 1987, and from 1989-1991 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science
13(5):579 (1973)

KOLD
Kold is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Oregon and Idaho AESs in 1993. It was selected from the
cross B-1285/Astrix. Its experimental designation was ORWM8407. It has midseason maturity and mid-short height. It
has moderate resistance to lodging and fair winterhardiness. The spikes are lax with rough awns. Aleurone is white. At
the time of release it was resistant to stripe rust, moderately resistant to scald and net blotch, and moderately susceptible
to BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 908 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1994-2006 for fall planting in
the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 35(5): 1503 (1995)

MAL
Mal is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 1980. It has mid-late season maturity,
medium height, moderate resistance to lodging, and good winter hardiness. At the time of evaluation it was moderately
resistant to scald and susceptible to stripe rust and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 569 in the UC Regional Cereal
Testing program from 1982-1985, in 1987, and from 1989-1996 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern
California.

ROBUR
Robur is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES. It has midseason maturity and fair straw
strength. It was evaluated as Entry 650 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1983-1987 for fall planting in
the intermountain region of northern California.

SCHUYLER
Schuyler is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the New York AES in 1968. It was selected from the
cross Hudson/Alpine. Its experimental designation was NY 5619B-3B-1. It has a compact spike, rough awns, medium
late maturity, medium short height, fair lodging resistance, and good winterhardiness. It has higher yields than Hudson
but lower test weight. Kernels are medium large and plump with white aleurone. At the time of release it was moderately
resistant to scald, stripe rust and powdery mildew, and susceptible to BYD. It subsequently became susceptible to stripe
rust. It was evaluated as Entry 131 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1985-1995 for fall planting in the
intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 12:124 (1972)

SCIO
Scio is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Oregon AES in 1981. Its experimental designation was
WA006747. It has midseason maturity, medium-short height, good lodging resistance, and fair winterhardiness. At the
time of evaluation it was moderately susceptible to scald and BYD, and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as
Entry 567 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-1985 and from 1987-2003 for fall planting in the
intermountain region of northern California.

SHOWIN
Showin is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Washington State University and Idaho AES in 1985. It
was selected from the cross 68-1448/2116-67. Its experimental designation was WA 2905-75. It has mid-late season
maturity and good winterhardiness. It is a semi-dwarf with mid-short straw and resistance to lodging. It has a prostrate
growth habit until jointing. The spike is lax and mid-long with some nodding. The awns are rough and long. Seed is
relatively small, long, and thin with semi-smooth, tightly adhering hulls, white aleurone, short rachilla hairs, and semi-
prominent veins. The crease is narrow at the base and flaring toward the awn. At the time of evaluation it was
moderately resistant to Cephalosporium stripe, moderately susceptible to scald, and susceptible to stripe rust and BYD. It
was evaluated as Entry 878 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1986-1987, from 1989-1991, and from
1993-1998 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 26:1079 (1986)
