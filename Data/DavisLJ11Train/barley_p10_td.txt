wrinkled. Veins are prominent. The crease is narrow and shallow at the base and flaring toward the beard end with a well
defined fold in the distal half. At the time of release, it was susceptible to BYD and moderately resistant to powdery
mildew. It was evaluated as Entry 655 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1983-1984 for spring planting in
the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 25:1123 (1985)

APEX
Apex is a two-row spring malting and feed barley. It was developed by Wilbur-Ellis Co. It was selected from the cross
Aramir*((Cebaco 6721*(Julia/3/Volla*L100)). It is late maturing and is mid-tall with fair straw strength. At the time of
evaluation it was resistant to leaf rust, net blotch, and powdery mildew. It was evaluated as Entry 721 in the UC Regional
Cereal Testing program in 1985 and in 1987 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and south-central coastal regions
of California and for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

AQUILA
Aquila is a six-row spring feed barley. It was released by the Utah AES in 2003. It was selected from the cross UT-S.D.
B1-1009/M72-395/3/Utah Short #2//ID633019/Woodvale/4/Steptoe/M27//Westbred Gustoe. Its experimental
designation was UT97B1480-1632. It is early heading and has very good lodging resistance. Plant height is mid-tall,
similar to Steptoe. It has a lax spike with limited overlapping of upper lateral spikelets. The peduncle is slightly curved.
The rachis has short hairs on its edges. At the bottom of the spike, the collar is of closed type or V-shaped. The basal
rachis internode has a short-straight to curved shape. The length of the rachis internodes is relatively constant from top to
bottom of the spike. Glumes are hairy on dorsal surfaces and edges. Glume awns are longer than the glumes. No hairs or
only a few are visible on the ventral surface of glumes. The awns are long, and of the fully rough type. The seed is
covered, mid-long with a depressed crease at the lemma base. Lemma teeth are few and confined to nerves, the rachilla
is of the short-haired type, hulls are slightly wrinkled, and the aleurone color is white. At the time of release it was
resistant to loose smut and covered smut, and susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1152 in the UC
Regional Cereal Testing program from 2004-2007 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

ARIVAT
Arivat is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the Arizona AES in 1940. It was recommended and
approved for certification in California in the late 1940's. It was selected from the cross Atlas/Vaughn made in 1927 in
California. It was adapted to the southwestern United States. Arivat has erect early growth, early maturity, short stature,
but relatively weak straw. The spike is short to mid-long, lax, erect to inclined. Lateral kernels overlap at the tip. The
rachis edges are long-haired. Awns are semi-smooth and long. The glume is covered with long hairs or hairs confined to
wide bands. The glume awn is one-and-one half to two times the length of the glume. Rachilla hairs are long. Kernels are
large with slightly wrinkled hulls and white or colorless aleurone. At the time of evaluation it was moderately susceptible
to leaf rust and net blotch, and susceptible to stripe rust, scald, and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 1 in the UC Regional
Cereal Testing program from 1980-1981 and from 1991-2001 for late fall planting in rainfed barley areas of the Central
Valley and south-central coastal regions of California. Agronomy Journal 52:661 (1960)

ATLAS 68
Atlas 68 is a six-rowed spring feed and malting barley. It was released by the California AES in 1969. It was selected
from the cross Atlas *3/CIho 3920-1//Atlas 46/3/4* Atlas/CIho 1179//2* Atlas 57. It has erect early growth and early to
midseason maturity. The straw is mid-tall and moderately stiff with medium-dense, erect spikes with semi-smooth awns.
The kernels are large, with white aleurone and a short-haired rachilla. At the time of evaluation it was resistant (tolerant)
to BYD, powdery mildew and scald. It was evaluated as Entry 6 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1980-
1981 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and south- central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 9(4):521
(1969)

AZURE
Azure is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by the North Dakota AES in cooperation with the USDA-
ARS in 1982. It was selected from the cross Bonanza//Nordic/NDB130. Its experimental designation was ND 1894. It
was adapted to barley growing areas of North Dakota, Minnesota and South Dakota. It is medium early maturing and
mid-tall with moderately strong straw. Spikes are medium lax, mid-long, and semi- nodding. Awns are smooth. The
glume awn is 1 to 2 times the length of the glume. A broad band of appressed hairs occur down the center of the glume.
Hulls are adhering and slightly wrinkled. Aleurone is blue. Rachilla hairs are long. Veins are moderately prominent and
