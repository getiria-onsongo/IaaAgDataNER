generation selection from the cross Sutter/Numar//Numar*4/Mildew Resistant White California Mariout. Its
experimental designation was 76264. The cross was designed to develop a Numar-type cultivar with resistance or
tolerance to scald, net blotch, powdery mildew and BYD, together with improved straw quality. UC 337 is mid-tall (2-3
inches taller then UC 476 and Prato) with moderately strong straw and medium early maturity (comparable to Prato and
Briggs). The basal rachis internode is straight. Rachis edges are covered with hair. The spike is parallel, dense and
inclined at maturity. The lemma awn is long and smooth. The glume awn is one-half the length of the lemma. The few
rachilla hairs are long and occur mainly at the tip. Kernels are mid-long to long with slightly wrinkled hulls and blue
aleurone. At the time of release UC 337 was resistant to moderately resistant to BYD, scald, net blotch, powdery mildew,
and leaf rust. It subsequently became moderately susceptible to scald, leaf rust, and powdery mildew, and susceptible to
stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 337 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1980 and from 1982-1997 for
late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 30:1154 (1990)

UC 476
UC 476 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the University of California AES in 1985. It is a F6
generation selection from the cross Sutter/Briggs//Prato sib made in 1971. Its experimental designation was 78011. The
cross was designed to develop a later maturing Prato-type with increased disease resistance and improved straw quality.
UC 476 is mid-tall (similar to Briggs and slightly taller than Prato) with good straw strength and medium maturity (about
three days later than Prato and about 7 days later than CM 72). The basal rachis internode is straight. The rachis edges
have few hairs. The spike is parallel, lax to dense, and inclined at maturity. The lemma awn is long and semi-smooth.
The glume awn is longer than the glume and is semi- smooth. The glume is one-half the length of the lemma. The
rachilla has few long hairs. Kernels are mid-long to long with wrinkled hulls and white aleurone. UC 476 is superior to
Prato in kernel assortment and test weight. At the time of release UC 476 was resistant to moderately resistant to scald,
net blotch, leaf rust, BYD (carries the Yd2 gene for resistance to BYD) and powdery mildew. It subsequently became
susceptible to scald and moderately susceptible to net blotch, leaf rust and stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 476 in
the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1980 and from 1982-2002 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the
south-central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 30:1154 (1990)

UC 566
UC 566 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the University of California AES in 1972. It is a composite
of 19 F7 generation lines from the backcross CM 67/Numar*2. Its experimental designation was 69-566F. The original
cross was made in 1966 and the final selection was completed in 1972. The cross was designed to develop a BYD
resistant Numar-type. It is adapted to areas where Numar and CM 67 are grown. UC 566 has short stature but weak straw
(susceptible to lodging). It is early in maturity. The basal rachis internode is straight. The rachis edges have few hairs.
The spike is parallel, lax, and nodding at maturity. The lemma awn is long and semi-smooth. The glume awn is equal in
length to the glume and is semi-smooth. The glume is greater than one-half the length of the lemma. The rachilla has
long hairs. Kernels are long with semi-wrinkled hulls and blue aleurone. At the time of evaluation it was resistant to
BYD (carries the Yd2 gene for resistance to BYD), moderately resistant to leaf rust and powdery mildew, moderately
susceptible to net blotch, and susceptible to scald. It was evaluated as Entry 190 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing
program from 1980-1988 for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California.

UC 828
UC 828 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 1995. It was selected from the cross
[(Numar*2/CI 2376)/Yellow Dwarf Resistant Numar]/2*UC 75012W. Its experimental designation was UCD 87-10395.
UC 828 was intended for late fall to early winter sowing in the Central Valley of California. It is medium maturing
(heads 1 to 4 days later than UC 337). It is short-statured (about 11 inches shorter than UC 337) as a result of the sdw
gene, lodging resistant, and has excellent grain yield potential. The spike is awned, mid-dense, waxy, and erect. There
are few hairs on the rachis edge. Glumes are more than one- half the length of the lemmas, completely covered by short
hairs, and have smooth awns less than equal in length to glumes. Lemmas have neither hair nor teeth. Rachilla hairs are
long. Lemma awns are long and semi- smooth. The peduncle is intermediate in length. The kernels are beige (non-blue)
and similar in size to those of UC 337. At the time of release it was moderately resistant to BYD, leaf rust, powdery
mildew, and net blotch, and susceptible to scald and stripe rust. It subsequently became moderately susceptible to net
blotch and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 828 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1991-1997 for late fall
planting in the Central Valley and the south-central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 36:466 (1996)
