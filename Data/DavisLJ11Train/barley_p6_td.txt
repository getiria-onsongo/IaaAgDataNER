heading at Tulelake, CA). The spike is rough awned, mid-dense, waxy, and semi-erect. The kernels are beige (the
aleurone non-blue) and covered. At the time of release UC 960 was resistant to stripe rust and moderately resistant to
BYD, leaf rust, net blotch and scald. It was evaluated as Entry 960 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from
1996-present for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 42:1374 (2002)

UC 969
UC 969 is a six-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by the California AES in 2001. It was selected from the cross
Sma1/Sunbar 401/3/UC 337. Sma1 has the parentage Steptoe/2*Diamant/3/Minn Dwarf 64.98- 8/Briggs/4/Asse. The
final hybridization was made by Paul Puri in 1991. Subsequent generations were handled in a pedigree selection
program. A final head row was selected for agronomic appearance in 1995 by Lynn Gallagher and designated UCD 95-
2,407 for preliminary yield trials. UC 969 is intended as a replacement for UC 603 primarily in marginal environments
where early heading is advantageous. UC 969 has spring growth habit and early maturity (about 3 days earlier than UC
603 and eight days earlier than UC 933). It is tall (averaging 35.4 inches, about 2 inches taller than UC 933 and UC 937),
with good lodging resistance (better than UC 933 and UC 937, but less than UC 603). Spikes are fully awned and erect,
with either waxy or non- waxy glumes. Glume hairs are short and confined to a band along the central rib but covered
toward the base. Glume awns are smooth and less than equal in length to glumes. Lemma awns are long and smooth.
Kernels are beige (non-blue aleurone), mid-long, and slightly wrinkled. Shatter resistance is good. At the time of release
UC 969 was moderately resistant to BYD, leaf rust, powdery mildew, scald and net blotch, and moderately
susceptible to stripe rust. Its early maturity allows it to escape serious damage from stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry
969 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1997-present for late fall planting in the Central Valley and the
south-central coastal regions of California. Crop Science 43:438 (2003)

WB-CHAMPION
WB Champion is a two-rowed spring feed barley. It was released by Westbred LLC in 2007. It was selected from the
cross Camas/Baronesse. Its experimental designation was YU501-385. It has midseason maturity, medium plant height
(averages about 40 inches in plant height), and fair straw strength. The stem has a slight waxy coating, and anthocyanin
can be present. It has a closed collar and the neck is straight. The leaves are slightly waxy in appearance and anthcyanin
is absent in the leaf auricle. Anthocyanin can be present in the veins of the lemma. The head is erect, tapering shaped,
slightly waxy and nodding at maturity. The glume length is 1/2 the length of the lemma and the glume is covered with
short hairs. The glume awns are equal to the length of the glumes and the surface is rough. The lemma is awned, and the
awns are rough. Lemma teeth are absent and lemma hairs are present, and the rachilla hair is long. The seed is long,
wrinkled, and has a white (or colorless) aleurone. It is susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 1218 in the UC
Regional Cereal Testing program from 2007-2009 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

WINTER BARLEY

BOYER
Boyer is a six-rowed winter feed barley. It was released by the Washington State University Agricultural Research
Center in 1975. It was developed from a single plant selection made in 1967 from the cross Luther//Rufflyn/White
Winter. Its experimental designations were WA 1094-67 and WSU-1094-67. Boyer was bred to replace other winter
barleys, Luther and Kamiak, and is moderately winter hardy. Winter survival is somewhat better than for Luther and
about equal to Kamiak. Boyer is mid-season in maturity (about 5 days later than Kamiak and about one week earlier than
Luther), has stiff straw and is medium tall (several inches shorter and more lodging resistant than Kamiak and Luther).
The spike is erect and mid-dense with little overlapping of the lateral kernels. It has rough awns. Rachis edges and
glumes are covered with numerous long hairs. The rachilla has numerous long hairs. Kernels are medium size with
smooth hulls and white or colorless aleurone. It is adapted to areas in the Pacific Northwest favorable to winter barley
survival. It is susceptible to stripe rust and moderately susceptible to scald and BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 574 in the
UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern
California. Crop Science 17(4):672 (1977)
