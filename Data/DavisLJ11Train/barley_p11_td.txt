there are few to no barbs on lateral veins. The crease is V- shaped. Kernels are broad at the center; lateral kernels are
moderately twisted. At the time of release it was resistant to stem rust, moderately resistant to spot blotch and net blotch,
and susceptible to loose smut, false loose smut, covered smut, powdery mildew, and barley stripe mosaic. It was
evaluated as Entry 690 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1984-1985 for spring planting in the
intermountain region of northern California. Crop Science 22:1083 (1982)

B1201
B1201 is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources. It is late maturing and
mid-tall (similar in plant height to Klages). It was evaluated as Entry 770 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program
from 1987-89 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

B1202
B1202 is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources in 1989. It was selected
from the cross RDB70-268/2B75-1223//Klages. Its experimental designation was 2B81-4038. It is medium late maturing
and mid-tall (similar in maturity and plant height to Klages). It is susceptible to lodging but has higher yield potential
than Klages. Spikes are lax. Awns are rough. Glumes are covered with long hairs. Hulls are adhering and slightly
wrinkled. Aleurone is colorless. Rachilla hairs are long. The central vein is weakly developed, inner lateral vein is
moderately developed, and outer lateral vein is weakly developed. There are no barbs on lateral veins. The crease is
narrow at the base and flared toward the beard end. Kernels are plump and very broad in relation to length. At the time of
evaluation it was moderately resistant to powdery mildew and BYD, moderately susceptible to scald and net blotch, and
susceptible to stripe rust. It was evaluated as Entry 771 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1987-2004 for
spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

B1215
B1215 is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources. It is medium late
maturing and mid-tall with fair straw strength. It was evaluated as Entry 906 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program
from 1990-1991 and from 1993-1995 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

B1603
B1603 is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources. It is medium late maturing
and mid-tall with poor straw strength. It was evaluated as Entry 826 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from
1990-1991 for spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

B1614
B1614 is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources. It is medium late maturing
and mid-tall with fair straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately susceptible to stripe
rust. It was evaluated as Entry 871 and Entry 907 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1992-1995 for
spring planting in the intermountain region of northern California.

B2601
B2601 is a six-rowed spring malting barley. It was released by Busch Agricultural Resources in 1989. It was selected
from the cross M31/6-rowed high extract composite cross. It is medium late maturing, about 4 days later than Morex. It
is a semi-dwarf, about 10 inches shorter than Morex, and has strong straw. It has smooth awns. Glumes are covered with
short hairs. Hulls are adhering and wrinkled. Rachilla hairs are short. The central vein is moderately prominent and
weakly developed at the center of the kernel. The inner lateral vein is moderately developed, and the outer lateral vein is
weakly developed. There are few barbs on lateral veins. The kernel has a humped back and is plump in relation to length.
At the time of release it was susceptible to scald, net blotch, stripe rust, and powdery mildew. It was evaluated as Entry
797 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1989-1991 for spring planting in the intermountain region of
northern California.

BACON
Bacon is a two-rowed spring malting barley. It was received for testing from Lynn Gallagher, UC Davis, in 1999. It is
medium maturing and medium height with good straw strength. At the time of evaluation it was moderately susceptible
to BYD. It was evaluated as Entry 1037 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program in 1999 for spring planting in the
