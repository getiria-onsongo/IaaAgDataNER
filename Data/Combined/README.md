# Combined dataset from many sources to use in training

Currently I am using p1-8 from the Davis dataset and pp 1-2 from the U Idaho.
With pp 1-8 of the Davis data set, CVAR and PLAN were below 90% on Davis pages 11 and 12, so I included pp 1-10.

Even then, stats still aren't great. Consider adding 5 more pages.
