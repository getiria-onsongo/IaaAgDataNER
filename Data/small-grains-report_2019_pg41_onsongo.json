Variety Descriptions\nSPRING BARLEY - Malt\nAAC Connect (TR04282) \u2013 released in 2016 by Agriculture Canada, AAC Connect has been in the trials for two years. AAC Connect has malt quality similar to AC Metcalfe. It is a mid-maturity two-rowed variety with moderate resistance to stem rust, spot blotch, spot form of net blotch (SFNB), and Fusarium head blight (FHB). Under Idaho growing conditions, AAC Connect was 3-4 inches taller than average with average lodging, had high test weight and percent plumps. In 2019, AAC Connect had high protein in the trials, and was at or a little lower than average for yield (Table 50). Lodging was high in the irrigated trials.\nAAC Synergy \u2013 released in 2015 by Agriculture Canada, AAC Synergy is a tworowed malt barley in the fifth year of testing in these trials. Overall yield was slightly below average (Table 49) and similar to ABI Growler, with average or better test weight and plumps. Height of Synergy is four inches less than Copeland, higher than Conrad, with similar tendencies for high lodging under irrigation. In Fusarium head blight (FHB) screening trials, AAC Synergy had one of the lowest indices for infection and was average to below average for levels of DON on the seed. AAC Synergy also expressed high levels of resistance to foliar pathogens. Synergy is being marketed by Syngenta in the US.\nABI Eagle (2B11-4949) \u2013 a newer release by Busch Agricultural Resources in 2018, Eagle has been tested in the variety trials for three years in which yield and test weight were comparable to ABI Voyager. ABI Eagle should replace Merit 57, having midlevel protein, with heading date two days later than Voyager, two \u2013 three inches\n\nshorter, and plumps were a little lower. Lodging was a little less than Voyager, but protein was higher. FHB reaction initially has been similar to ABI Voyager.\nABI Growler (2B09-3425) \u2013 a 2015 release from Busch Agricultural Resources, ABI Growler is a two-rowed malt that exhibits high yield potential under irrigation, although the three-year yield and test weight averages were lower than the average other two-rowed malt barley in these trials (Table 49). Growler hits the average for height, test weight, proteins and plumps, and was one day later in heading date with less lodging than Voyager. ABI Growler may produce more thins under high temperatures, which can be reduced by increasing irrigation. For FHB data, DON accumulations were similar to Voyager.\nABI Voyager (B3719) \u2013 a 2011 release from Busch Agricultural Resources, Voyager consistently out yields many other two-rowed malt varieties in the production area. Three-year average yields were below LCS Odyssey and similar to Moravian 69, with higher test weight and similar lodging. Voyager is similar to Conrad in test weight, has a little earlier heading date, lower protein, but is taller (2-4 inches). ABI Voyager is susceptible to cereal cyst nematode (CCN), and for FHB shows DON accumulation at a little less than average.\nAC Metcalfe (TR232) \u2013 two-rowed malting barley released in 1994 by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada with excellent quality, lower yield potential than average, and taller with similar test weight and lodging to Conrad. It is widely adapted to western US and Canadian conditions, but as it is tall, it may lodge under higher production conditions. It is moderately susceptible to\n\n34\n\n\n": {"entity 1": {"start": 37, "end": 43, "label": "CROP"}, "entity 2": {"start": 51, "end": 62, "label": "CVAR"}, "entity 3": {"start": 64, "end": 71,
