      "4 :  The following are descriptions of barley cultivars evaluated in California from 1981 to 2011.\n",
      "5 :  The descriptions are based on published cultivar releases and data from the UC Regional Cereal Evaluation Tests conducted each year throughout California.\n",
      "6 :  Yield performance data for most of the cultivars can be found in University of California, Davis,\n",

      "14 :  It was released by the USDA-ARS and the Idaho AES in 1991.\n",
      "15 :  It was selected from the cross Steveland/Luther//Wintermalt.\n",
      "16 :  Its experimental designation was 79Ab812.\n",
      "17 :  It has rough awns, midseason maturity, good winter hardiness, and is medium height with intermediate lodging resistance.\n",
      "18 :  Spikes are short and dense.\n",
      "19 :  Kernels have white aleurone and short rachilla hairs.\n",
      "20 :  It is susceptible to stripe rust, scald, and snow mold, and moderately susceptible to BYD.\n",
      "21 :  It was evaluated as Entry 697 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1982-2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n",

      "27 :  Its experimental designation was STAB 113.\n",
      "28 :  Maja, like the 88Ab536 parent, is a facultative cultivar: it has a ﬁwinterﬂ allele at the Vrn-H1 locus on chromosome 5H but lacks the repressor encoded by the Vrn-H2 locus on 4H.\n",
      "29 :  This configuration of vernalization genes can lead to early maturity under some environmental conditions, and this feature could be an advantage in terms of flexibility in planting date, irrigation savings, and drought avoidance.\n",
      "30 :  It is a standard height selection (averages about 42 inches in plant height, with fair straw strength) with rough awns and a semi-compact spike.\n",
      "31 :  The grain has white aleurone.\n",
      "32 :  Maja has high test weight and showed promise as malting barley in repeated micro-malting tests, but it was ultimately not approved by the American Malting Barley Association (AMBA).\n",
      "33 :  It has a lower grain protein and enzyme level than is desired for production of lighter beers.\n",
      "34 :  At the time of evaluation it was resistant to stripe rust and susceptible to scald.\n",
      "35 :  It was evaluated as Entry 1129 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 2001-2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California.\n",

      "43 :  It has rough awns and a semi-compact spike.\n",
      "44 :  At the time of evaluation it was resistant to stripe rust and moderately susceptible to scald, net blotch, and BYD.\n",
      "45 :  It was evaluated as Entry 964 in the UC Regional Cereal Testing program from 1997-2006 for fall planting in the intermountain region of northern California and in 2008 for fall planting in the Central Valley of California.\n",
