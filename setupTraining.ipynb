      "36 :  It is medium late maturing (3 days earlier than Manley, 1 day later than Harrington).\n",
      "37 :  CDC Copeland averages 7 cm taller than Harrington and 5 cm taller than Manley, and has good resistance to lodging (much stronger straw than Harrington, slightly stronger straw than Manley).\n",
      "38 :  It has higher test weight and plumper kernels than Manley, and kernel plumpness similar to Harrington.\n",
